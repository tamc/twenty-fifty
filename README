DEPENDENCIES
ruby 1.9.2 (including development headers)
sqlite3 (including development headers)

INSTALATION
Read bootstraph.sh to get a sense the dependencies and how to install them.

Otherwise:
1. Install the dependencies
2. sh setup.sh
3. sh run.sh
4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your web browser

If that doesn't work, the most common reason is that your ruby 1.9.1 has been installed with a different name (ruby1.9.1; ruby191). Edit the command names at the top of the setup.sh and run.sh files to reflect that fact and try again. You may also need to be an administrator to install the required ruby gems. On a unix system you could try running sudo rake gems:install from this directory.
