DEPENDENCIES
ruby 1.9.1 (including development headers)
sqlite3 (including development headers)

INSTALATION
On ubuntu 10.04:
sh ./bootstrap_on_ubuntu.sh
...should install the required dependencies and start the server.

Otherwise:
1. Install the dependencies
2. sh setup.sh
3. sh run.sh
4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your web browser

If that doesn't work, the most common reason is that your ruby 1.9.1 has been installed with a different name (ruby1.9.1; ruby191). Edit the command names at the top of the setup.sh and run.sh files to reflect that fact and try again.
