IF YOU CHANGE THE CODE

rake dev:updated_view

UPDATING THE UNDERLYING EXCEL MODEL
The calculating engine of this tool is contained in lib/sheets. The files in this directory are ruby versions of a Microsoft Excel 2007 model, which is contained in this directory as 2050Model.xlsx.

If you update the 2050Model.xlsx excel model, then you need to recreate the ruby version of that model. You also need to DELETE ALL THE DATA in the sqlite databases contained in the db/ directory. This will be done automatically.
 
You can update the model by:
1. Ensuring your 2050Model.xlsx is saved in the lib/ directory
2. rake dev:update_ruby_from_excel 
3. Checking that lib/excel_model.rb still refers to the correct cells in the sheet (note, for instance, that re-saving the excel model will sometimes result in the sheet order in the underlying file to be changed)
